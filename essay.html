    <br><br>
    In the beginning there was nothing. All was black, all matter in the universe was a great void of endless non-existence. We were in total darkness. And then, one day, we began telling stories, often to keep ourselves warm and occupied during long dark nights by the fire. Humans are story tellers by nature but also by necessity, and the power of storytelling is one akin to magic. It is perhaps the only way to enter another human’s mind and leave something behind. Of course we do this with words, but the particular arrangement of words acts like the key sequence to unlocking and blowing wide open the doors. The more beauty in the arrangement of the words, the more effectiveness. Beauty penetrates. Sadly, I don’t have a mathematical formula to prove this to you, but that, of course, is a different story.

    The simplest stories we grow up with as kids tend to contain simple dualities of good vs. evil. Darkness vs. light. Are children really afraid of the dark, or are the stories a catalyst in populating the darkness with monsters? And do we really stop being afraid of the dark as we get older? 
    <br><br>
    Within the stories that we know by heart, emerges a collective imagination filled with metaphors, idioms, sayings, proverbs, references and symbols that we draw upon throughout our lives to communicate both more efficiently and more intimately. When my friend is telling me about how quickly she’s fallen in love with someone new, I can easily reference Romeo and Juliet to warn her about the foibles of fiery passions. And when I get carried away with myself on a cloud of ephemeral good feeling and self satisfaction, any one of the following can be invoked by my friends to make a point: Narcissus, Prometheus, Sisyphus.

    These of course are Western myths, and within them is evoked the western imagination, and with it, according to a number of thinking minds, the Western character. One can argue, and many have argued, that the inner world is shaped like clay, but by what hands, there is seldom agreement, or acknowledgement. The argument herein is those hands being the hands of mythology, and the fingerprints in clay are the myths we absorb as children, and later through continuing education and mere existence in the world, education, conversation, and entertainment. Therefore, the very character and the elements of these myths are particularly significant is shaping this inner world, but somehow, we do not take them so seriously.

    To take as a brief example, the now absolutely universal story of Star Wars, one which generations have been exposed to, and one which the Western world has exported very successfully to the planet, in true hegemonic hyperdrive. Within it are encased the seedlings of the most classical story of all, touched upon in the beginning: Good vs. evil. Light vs. Dark. A cornerstone of what Joseph Campbell cals “the hero’s journey.” Star Wars, Luke Skywalker and of course, Darth Vader, are cultural phenomenons. Even for those who did not indulge in this stream of entertainment, the blueprint is the same. We can look at multinational blockbusters across the spectrum and find the same traces - from the Lord of the Rings to James Bond, to the Ghost Busters. There’s always a bright hero to save us from the forces of darkness.

    To go further back in time, in Western history we register a period known as the ‘Dark Ages’ - rife with witches, medieval torture, false beliefs and blasphemy. A time when God turned against us through the men that represented him. We were saved from its dark talons, after period of renaissance, by the bright light of the Enlightenment, of science and rationality. Science as a candle in the dark.* Science that measured all things, relied on data and stark findings, asked hard questions and only accepted hard evidence. But of course a science that was also turned against us by the men that represented it. When science was invoked to rationalize the hierarchy and thus superiority of races, the triumph of the Illuminated over the many dark continents, and the necessity to plunge deep into the heart of darkness. A tale as old as time, good vs. evil. Light vs. Dark.
